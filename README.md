# Threes
Threes is a simple gambling dice game where the goal is to get the lowest score possible.  The classic game typically starts with each player tossing a dollar bill into the center of the table.  Players take turns rolling 5 6-sided dice, and the player with the lowest score wins.  The rounds are quick, so it is easy to play many rounds over the course of a night until at least one player's wallet is empty.

## Getting Started
#### Instructions:
- Place your bets
- Roll the dice
- Choose at least one die to "save" (Saved dice will not roll again)
- Threes are worth zero points! Everything else is face value.
- Once all 5 dice are saved, the score is totalled and the next player takes their turn
- If a tie occurs, bets are doubled and the round starts again!
- The game is officially over when one player runs out of money
