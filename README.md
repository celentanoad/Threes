# Threes
Threes is a simple gambling dice game where the goal is to get the lowest score possible.  The classic game typically starts with each player tossing a dollar bill into the center of the table.  Players take turns rolling 5 6-sided dice, and the player with the lowest score wins.  The rounds are quick, so it is easy to play many rounds over the course of a night until at least one player's wallet is empty.

## Getting Started
#### Instructions:
Start the game by clicking the "bet" button (bets will automatically be placed for each player). Each player will take their turn by rolling the dice, and choosing at least one die to "save". The total of all the saved dice will represent the current score, and once all the dice are saved, the next player will take their turn and attempt to beat the previous score.  If players' scores are tied, bets are doubled and the round starts again! The game is officially over when one player runs out of money. Click the link below to play!
